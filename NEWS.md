# toscpm changelog

All notable changes to toscpm. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org):
bump the **minor** version when a tool or dotfile is added or changed, the
**patch** version for fixes, and the **major** version for breaking changes to
the CLI. The current version lives in the [`VERSION`](VERSION) file (the single
source of truth); tag each release `vX.Y.Z` to match.

## 1.3.0

- Add a `VERSION` file and this `NEWS.md` as the single source of truth for the
  toscpm version. `toscpm --version` prints it and `toscpm check` shows it on
  the Self line.

## 1.2.0

- Add `typst` (typesetting system) and `tidy` (HTML Tidy, needed by
  `R CMD check` to validate a package's HTML manual).
- Add the `GhDeb` recipe for tools whose only prebuilt Linux artifact is a
  Debian package; it is unpacked no-admin via `dpkg-deb` (falling back to
  `ar` + `tar`), reusing the `GhBin` basename-based install path.

## 1.1.1

- Add `glab` (GitLab CLI) Linux/Windows recipes and a remotes health check.

## 1.1.0

- Rename `check.py` to `toscpm` with an `install` subcommand and `bin/`
  PATH-linking.
- Track `yazi`, the global `CLAUDE.md` and `glab`; fix symlink detection.
- Install `claude` via its native installer instead of npm.
- Various dotfile updates (tmux, nvim/LazyVim, bash, PowerShell, Rprofile).

## 1.0.0

- Initial release: dotfiles plus a single `toscpm` command to verify, install,
  and set up the dev environment on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
